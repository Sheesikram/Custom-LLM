# Custom LLM Project

This project showcases the implementation and usage of a custom Large Language Model (LLM) built to explore advanced NLP tasks. The notebook includes workflows for training, fine-tuning, and integrating LLMs with state-of-the-art tools like Hugging Face, FAISS, and LangChain.

---

## Features
- Implementation of NLP tasks like text generation, summarization, and semantic search.
- Fine-tuning LLMs using pre-trained transformer models.
- Vector search integration for efficient similarity matching using FAISS.
- Interactive coding and visualization in Jupyter Notebook.
- Flexible, modular design to adapt to different use cases.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for all implementations.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Interactive development and visualization environment.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Pre-trained model utilization and fine-tuning.
- **FAISS**: High-performance vector similarity search.
- **LangChain**: To structure workflows and applications using LLMs.
- **PyTorch / TensorFlow**: For building and customizing models.
- **Docker**: Optional containerization for deployment and reproducibility.
